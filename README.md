# CSV-Combiner

Takes in two csv files as input and returns a new csv file containing the two csv files combined - 

CSV Combiner
Write a command line program that takes several CSV files as arguments. Each CSV file (found in the fixtures directory of this repo) will have the same columns. Your script should output a new CSV file to stdout that contains the rows from each of the inputs along with an additional column that has the filename from which the row came (only the file's basename, not the entire path). Use filename as the header for the additional column.

Considerations
You should use coding best practices. Your code should be re-usable and extensible.
Your code should be testable by a CI/CD process.
Unit tests should be included.
